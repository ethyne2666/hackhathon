# 🛒 Daily Basis – Essential Delivery Web App

Daily Basis is a subscription-based e-commerce web application built with **Django**.  
Unlike regular one-time order apps, our platform allows users to **schedule daily/weekly recurring deliveries** for essentials like milk, bread, eggs, vegetables, etc.  

---

Our aim was to create a real-world solution for daily essential deliveries with features like subscription scheduling, pause/resume orders, and time-slot based delivery.

## 🚀 Features
- User authentication (Signup/Login/Profile Management).  
- Product listings with detailed product pages.  
- Cart & Orders (one-time + subscription-based).  
- Schedule recurring deliveries (daily/weekly).  
- Pause/resume delivery option.  
- Built fully with **Django** (backend + templates).
